    <h1>Hi Welcome to My Programming Portfolio<h1>
    <p> This is the home page of my Programming Portfolio for CSC 106 Summer 2022 at The University of Rhode Island. This is where people can have access to my javascripts from this course by simply clicking the "Javascripts" button at the top of the page.
        People can also click the "About Me" button at the top of the page to learn a little more about me. I hope you enjoy following my progress in the course and learning a little about me. </p>
