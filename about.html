    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="alec.jpg">  
    <p style="color: white"> My name is Alec Hughes and I am currently a third year electrical engineering student, and after college I plan on working in that field as well. In addition to school, I am also playing soccer in college. Playing and watching soccer is my biggest hobby as I am doing both almost every day. I am a sporty person so a lot of hobbies include watching and playing other sports such as basketabll, baseball, and football. Some other activites I like to do is travel, fish, and go to the beach. The most intersting place I have traveled to is Australia. Some other things about me is that I have two older sisters and a dog and I also live in Connecticut.</p>
